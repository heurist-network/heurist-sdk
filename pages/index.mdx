# Heurist SDK

**Heurist SDK** is the official TypeScript library for the Heurist AI API

This library provides convenient access to the Heurist REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.

The SDK is in Beta stage. To get API key access, fill in the form https://heurist.ai/dev-access with a legit project use case. We will get back to you shortly with some free credits. For individual developers, we will typically give 2000~10000 credits (the API quota is equivalent to that of the same amount of HUE token). For Web3 partner projects with a social presence and community (regardless of the size), we will provide you free access for an extended period of time.
